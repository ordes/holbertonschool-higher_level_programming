# Project README

This repository contains several tasks written in Python. Each task corresponds to a specific functionality, and the files contain code that addresses different programming challenges. Below is a brief description of each task, along with the associated filename.

## Task Descriptions

### 0. Addition Program
**Filename**: `0-add.py`  
This task imports the `add(a, b)` function from the file `add_0.py` and uses it to perform an addition operation. The program prints the result of adding 1 and 2, i.e., `1 + 2 = 3`.

### 1. Calculator Program
**Filename**: `1-calculation.py`  
This program imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and performs mathematical operations. It then prints the result of the calculation, allowing for basic arithmetic computations.

### 2. Arguments Counter
**Filename**: `2-args.py`  
This program prints the number of command-line arguments passed to it, followed by the list of those arguments. It provides a simple way to check how many arguments were provided when running the script.

### 3. Infinite Addition
**Filename**: `3-infinite_add.py`  
This task involves writing a program that prints the result of adding all command-line arguments passed to the script. It calculates the sum of all the arguments passed and prints the result. Additionally, it prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

### 5. Variable Load
**Filename**: `5-variable_load.py`  
In this task, the program imports a variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value. It demonstrates the use of importing specific variables from another Python module.
